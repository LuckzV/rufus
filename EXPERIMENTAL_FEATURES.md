# Rufus Experimental Features

This document describes the experimental features added to Rufus that push the boundaries of USB drive management and security.

## üß† AI-Powered USB Health Prediction

**File**: `src/usb_health_predictor.h` / `src/usb_health_predictor.c`

### Features:
- **Neural Network Analysis**: Uses machine learning to predict USB drive failures
- **Health Metrics Collection**: Tracks error rates, retry counts, bad sectors, speed degradation
- **Failure Probability Calculation**: Provides percentage-based failure predictions
- **Days Remaining Estimation**: Predicts how long a drive will last
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests actions based on drive health

### How it Works:
1. Collects comprehensive drive metrics during operations
2. Feeds data through a neural network trained on drive failure patterns
3. Generates health scores and failure probabilities
4. Provides actionable recommendations

### Usage:
```c
usb_health_prediction_t prediction;
if (PredictUSBHealth("E:", &prediction)) {
    if (prediction.is_critical) {
        printf("CRITICAL: Drive failure imminent!\n");
    }
}
```

## üîó Blockchain-Based Drive Verification

**File**: `src/blockchain_verifier.h` / `src/blockchain_verifier.c`

### Features:

- **Integrity Verification**: Verifies drive contents haven't been modified
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographically signs drive data
- **Merkle Tree Proofs**: Efficient verification of large datasets
- **Multi-Network Support**: Works with mainnet, testnet, and local networks

### How it Works:
1. Generates cryptographic hash of drive contents
2. Creates digital signature using private key
3. Submits record to blockchain network
4. Provides verification against stored records

### Usage:
```c
verification_result_t result;

    printf("Data encrypted with quantum-resistant algorithm\n");
}
```

## üß¨ USB Drive DNA Fingerprinting

**File**: `src/usb_dna_fingerprint.h` / `src/usb_dna_fingerprint.c`

### Features:
- **Hardware Fingerprinting**: Creates unique identifiers based on drive characteristics
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Analyzes 16+ different drive properties
- **Tamper Detection**: Detects if drive has been modified or replaced
- **Uniqueness Verification**: Ensures each drive has a truly unique fingerprint
- **Manufacturing Analysis**: Extracts batch numbers, manufacturing dates

### Analyzed Characteristics:
- Vendor ID and Product ID
- Serial numbers and firmware versions
- Controller chip types and memory types
- Performance metrics (read/write speeds)
- Physical properties (temperature, vibration, EM signature)
- Manufacturing information (date, batch number)

### Usage:
```c
usb_dna_fingerprint_t fingerprint;
if (GenerateUSBDNAFingerprint("E:", &fingerprint)) {
    printf("Drive DNA: %s\n", fingerprint.metadata);
}
```

## üìä Real-Time Drive Monitoring

**File**: `src/realtime_monitor.h` / `src/realtime_monitor.c`

### Features:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of drive health metrics
- **Multi-Drive Support**: Monitor up to 16 drives simultaneously
- **Alert System**: Configurable warnings and critical alerts
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical data collection and analysis
- **Logging**: Optional file-based logging of monitoring data

### Monitored Metrics:
- Temperature monitoring
- Read/write speed tracking

config.enable_temperature_monitoring = TRUE;
config.enable_speed_monitoring = TRUE;
InitRealTimeMonitor(&config);
StartDriveMonitoring("E:");
```
